A number of more challenging projects for you to solve. [[Some of these may turn
into examples in the book, and so at some point might disappear from here]]

Rats & Mazes
=======================================================================

First, create a *Blackboard* (cite reference) which is an object on which anyone
may record information. This particular blackboard draws a maze, and is used as
information comes back about the structure of a maze from the rats that are
investigating it.

Now create the maze itself. Like a real maze, this object reveals very little
information about itself - given a coordinate, it will tell you whether there
are walls or spaces in the four directions immediately surrounding that
coordinate, but no more. For starters, read the maze in from a text file but
consider hunting on the internet for a maze-generating algorithm. In any event,
the result should be an object that, given a maze coordinate, will report walls
and spaces around that coordinate. Also, you must be able to ask it for an entry
point to the maze.

Finally, create the maze-investigating **Rat** class. Each rat can communicate
with both the blackboard to give the current information and the maze to request
new information based on the current position of the rat. However, each time a
rat reaches a decision point where the maze branches, it creates a new rat to go
down each of the branches. Each rat is driven by its own thread. When a rat
reaches a dead end, it terminates itself after reporting the results of its
final investigation to the blackboard.

The goal is to completely map the maze, but you must also determine whether the
end condition will be naturally found or whether the blackboard must be
responsible for the decision.

An example implementation by Jeremy Meyer::
